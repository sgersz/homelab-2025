# üè† Home Lab 2025: Secure, Scalable Virtual Infrastructure

## Goal / Problem Statement
I set out to build a home lab that mirrors enterprise-level cloud and network environments, providing a hands-on platform to experiment with **virtualization, containerization, automation, and security** while managing real-world complexity at home.

My goal was to create a secure, scalable, and segmented infrastructure where I could:
- Test cloud deployments and DevOps pipelines
- Explore identity and access management
- Implement Zero Trust principles
- Automate deployments and network operations

## Technologies Used
- **Virtualization:** Proxmox, Unraid
- **Containerization:** Docker, Ansible
- **Networking:** Unifi, VLANs, Pi-hole
- **Storage:** Unraid NAS, Plex, Sonarr, Radarr
- **Security:** Pi-hole DNS filtering, Unifi firewall rules
- **Home Automation:** Home Assistant, wall-mounted tablets

## Architecture Overview
‚úÖ **Virtualization Layer:** Started with Proxmox ‚Üí migrated to Unraid for native Docker support and easier container management.  
‚úÖ **Containerization & Automation:** Deployed applications using Docker; automated provisioning and updates using Ansible playbooks.  
‚úÖ **Network Segmentation:** Created VLANs across Unifi switches to separate IoT, work, personal, and guest traffic for security and QoS.  
‚úÖ **Security:** Installed redundant Pi-hole servers for DNS filtering and ad-blocking; configured firewall rules to limit east-west and outbound traffic.  
‚úÖ **Storage & Media:** Built an Unraid-based NAS serving Plex, with automated downloads via Sonarr and Radarr for media organization.  
‚úÖ **Home Automation:** Configured Home Assistant; deployed wall-mounted tablets using Fully Kiosk Browser as centralized smart home control panels.

## Process
1. **Virtualization Platform** ‚Äì Deployed Proxmox; migrated to Unraid for Docker container support and increased flexibility.
2. **Containerization & Automation** ‚Äì Automated application deployments with Docker and Ansible to minimize manual maintenance.
3. **Network Security** ‚Äì Installed redundant Pi-hole servers; configured Unifi firewall rules for DNS filtering and network protection.
4. **Network Segmentation** ‚Äì Designed VLANs to isolate IoT, personal, work, and guest traffic to reduce risk and optimize performance.
5. **Storage & Media Management** ‚Äì Built Unraid NAS to store backups and media; integrated Plex, Sonarr, and Radarr for automated library management.
6. **Home Automation** ‚Äì Integrated Home Assistant; repurposed tablets into control hubs for centralized smart device management.

## Key Outcomes
‚úÖ Built a **fully segmented, secure network** supporting enterprise-level security practices at home.  
‚úÖ Automated **90% of deployment and updates** across apps and containers using Ansible.  
‚úÖ Created a **centralized smart home platform** combining media management, automation, and secure networking.  
‚úÖ Gained hands-on experience in **IAM principles, firewall management, Zero Trust segmentation, and infrastructure as code.**
